    "## Important Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "**It is important that you follow the instructions below to the letter - we will not be responsible for incorrect marking due to non-standard practices.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You *MUST* have your environment set up as in the [README](https://github.com/michael-camilleri/IAML2018) and you *must activate this environment before running this notebook*:\n",
    "```\n",
    "source activate py3iaml\n",
    "cd [DIRECTORY CONTAINING GIT REPOSITORY]\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "# Navigate to this file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the instructions carefully, especially where asked to name variables with a specific name. Wherever you are required to produce code you should use code cells, otherwise you should use markdown cells to report results and explain answers. In most cases we indicate the nature of answer we are expecting (code/text), and also provide the code/markdown cell where to put it\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are some questions which are **specific to those taking the Level-11 version** of the course (INFR11182 and INFR11152). These are clearly marked with the words **(LEVEL 11)** and must be completed by those taking the Level 11 course. Those on the Level 10 version (INFR10069) may (and are advised to) attempt such questions but this will not affect their mark in any way, nor will they get feedback on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The .csv files that you will be using are located at `./datasets` (i.e. use the `datasets` directory **adjacent** to this file).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Keep your answers brief and concise. Most written questions can be answered with 2-3 lines of explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure to show **all** your code/working. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write readable code. While we do not expect you to follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) to the letter, the code should be adequately understandable, with plots/visualisations correctly labelled. **Do** use inline comments when doing something non-standard. When asked to present numerical values, make sure to represent real numbers in the appropriate precision to exemplify your answer. Marks *WILL* be deducted if the marker cannot understand your logic/results.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collaboration:** You may discuss the assignment with your colleagues, provided that the writing that you submit is entirely your own. That is, you should NOT borrow actual text or code from other students. We ask that you provide a list of the people who you've had discussions with (if any).\n",
    "\n",
    "### SUBMISSION Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT:** You must submit this assignment by **Thursday 18/10/2018 at 16:00**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Late submissions:** The policy stated in the School of Informatics is that normally you will not be allowed to submit coursework late. See the [ITO webpage](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/student-services/ito/admin/coursework-projects/late-coursework-extension-requests) for exceptions to this, e.g. in case of serious medical illness or serious personal problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resubmission:** If you submit your file again, the previous submission is **overwritten**. We will mark the version that is in the submission folder at the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "All submissions happen electronically. To submit:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fill out this notebook, and save it, making sure to **KEEP the name of the file UNCHANGED**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On a DICE environment, open the terminal, navigate to the location of this notebook, and submit this notebook file using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```submit iaml cw1 \"01_Analysis.ipynb\"```\n",
    "\n",
    "  What actually happens in the background is that your file is placed in a folder available to markers. If you submit a file with the same name into the same location, **it will *overwrite* your previous submission**. You can check the status of your submissions with the `show_submissions` command.\n",
    "  \n",
    "1. **Distance Learners:** To copy your work onto DICE (so that you can use the `submit` command) you can use `scp` or `rsync` (you may need to install these yourself). You can copy files to `student.ssh.inf.ed.ac.uk`, then ssh into it in order to submit. The following is an example (replace entries in `[square brackets]` with your specific details):\n",
    "```\n",
    "filename=\"01_Analysis.ipynb\"\n",
    "local_scp_filepath=[DIRECTORY CONTAINING GIT REPOSITORY]${filename}\n",
    "server_address=student.ssh.inf.ed.ac.uk\n",
    "scp -r ${local_scp_filepath} [YOUR USERNAME]@${server_address}:${filename}\n",
    "# rsync -rl ${local_scp_filepath} [YOUR USERNAME]@${server_address}:${filename}\n",
    "ssh [YOUR USERNAME]@${server_address}\n",
    "ssh student.login\n",
    "submit iaml cw1 \"01_Analysis.ipynb\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Marking Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "The Level 10 and Level 11 points are marked out of different totals, however these are all normalised to 100%.\n",
    "\n",
    "**70-100%** results/answer correct plus extra achievement at understanding or analysis of results. Clear explanations, evidence of creative or deeper thought will contribute to a higher grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "**60-69%** results/answer correct or nearly correct and well explained.\n",
    "\n",
    "**50-59%** results/answer in right direction but significant errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**40-49%** some evidence that the student has gained some understanding, but not answered the questions\n",
    "properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**0-39%** serious error or slack work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that while this is not a programming assignment, in questions which involve visualisation of results and/or long cold snippets, some marks may be deducted if the code is not adequately readable."

    "## Description of the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is based on the 20 Newsgroups Dataset. This dataset is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups, each corresponding to a different topic. Some of the newsgroups are very closely related to each other (e.g. comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware, comp.sys.mac.hardware), while others are highly unrelated (e.g misc.forsale, soc.religion.christian). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three versions of the 20 Newsgroups Dataset. In this assignment we will use the `bydate` matlab version in which documents are sorted by date into training (60%) and test (40%) sets, newsgroup-identifying headers are dropped and duplicates are removed. This collection comprises roughly 61,000 different words, which results in a bag-of-words representation with frequency counts. More specifically, each document is represented by a 61,000 dimensional vector that contains the counts for each of the 61,000 different words present in the respective document. \n",
    "\n",
    "To save you time and to make the problem manageable with limited computational resources, we preprocessed the original dataset. We will use documents from only 5 out of the 20 newsgroups, which results in a 5-class problem. The class is conveniently stored in the `class` column. More specifically the 5 classes correspond to the following newsgroups: \n",
    "1. `alt.atheism`\n",
    "2. `comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware`\n",
    "3. `comp.sys.mac.hardware`\n",
    "4. `rec.sport.baseball`\n",
    "5. `rec.sport.hockey `\n",
    "\n",
    "However, note here that classes 2-3 and 4-5 are rather closely related. Additionally, we computed the [mutual information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information) of each word with the class attribute and selected the some words out of 61,000 that had highest mutual information. For very sophisticated technical reasons (which you should know!) 1 was added to all the word counts in part 1. The resulting representation is much more compact and can be used directly to perform our experiments in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: The data was preprocessed by a very busy PhD student... and hence should never be taken to be perfect at face value!"

When we look at the min and max values for each class, and then look at the mean, we see that in general the counts for each word are quite low (as the means are much closer to the min values) however there are some anomalies with abnormally large counts (max values seem to be near 600). The mean classification of 3.09 also suggests that we have a roughly even spread of data across all classes which is good."

    "Let us analyse this further. The stripplot illustrates the distribution of a single attribute. We can also visualise the joint distribution of two variables by using a scatter plot. Again, we want to add a bit of jitter into the data so that is easier to see which parts of the space (2-dimensional in our case) have larger probability densities. For this, you will be using the function `scatter_jitter` from the `utils` library which we provided. This function takes as input two numpy arrays containing the features of interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Code] First, pick two attributes of your choice from `news_raw` and use the provided function to plot their joint distribution. Do this twice (i.e. pick 4 attributes and do plots between two pairs: you do not need to plot between each possible pair). You can play around with the amount of noise added by tweaking the `jitter` parameter. Alternatively, you can just use its default value which is set to 0.2. Label the axes appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Text] Do these plots increase or reduce the possibility of the data-set containing outliers? Why or why not? How would you visualise the data to verify this? **N.B. There is no need to code anything for this part, just indicate a reasonable type of plot, and what you expect to see.**"

    "These plots seem to indicate the presence of quite a few outliers in the data. The words I have chosen to plot are not what would be considered stop words i.e. we would not expect their counts to be particularly high. However as we can see there are several documents for which there are very high counts of these words. Although these may in fact be valid observations it is likely that they are rare appearances and will only negatively influence our classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "To verify this it might be useful to produce a boxplot for the frequencies of words - this would make it more clear as to whether only a small number of documents (the would-be outliers) have abnormally large word-counts. It would also be useful to plot the above data again without any jitter as this would show clearly any outliers to the main cluster of data points.\n",

    "Since the attributes chosen were based on mutual information with the class attribute we can assume that stop words are not attributes without inspecting them all. Under this assumption we would not expect any attribute to have an extremely high count. Therefore it would make sense to remove any documents that have very high frequencies on attributes - these may be extreme examples or just errors but either way they are likely to reduce the accuracy of our classifier. It is also likely that they are very uncommon in the dataset i.e. a very small fraction of the observations we have.\n",

    "The slight drop in accuracy from the training data to the testing data (88% to 82%) is an indication of overfitting, perhaps the data could be cleaned better. We see a similar confusion matrix  to the one obtained on the training data (in terms of which classes were being misclassified as which), which is to be expected for the same reasons as explained before. The accuracy of the baseline on test data is higher (21% to 25%) although this is not very surprising. The method of classification is so simple and crude it may as well have chosen the class randomly i.e it is clearly severely underfitting the data."
